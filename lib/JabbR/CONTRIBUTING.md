## Contributing code

### Coding Guidelines

* Sort your usings
* Spaces not tabs (I won't even look at the PR if you use tabs)
* Follow the **existing** conventions you see in the project (that means, brace style, formatting etc).
* If you aren't sure about something, ask in the [meta](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/meta) room on jabbr.


### Project Workflow

Our workflow is loosely based on [Github Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). We actively develop in the **dev** branch. This means that all pull requests by contributors need to be developed and submitted to the dev branch.
The master branch is always stable and deployable.

### Submitting Pull requests

Make sure you can build the code. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. If you don't know what a pull request is
read this https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. 
[Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](http://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/)

When making CSS changes or changes to any styles, an image must be submitted with the pull request.
