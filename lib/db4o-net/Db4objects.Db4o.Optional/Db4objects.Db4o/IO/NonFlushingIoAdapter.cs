	/// Delegating IoAdapter that does not pass on calls to sync
	/// data to the underlying device. <br /><br />
	/// This IoAdapter can be used to improve performance at the cost of a
	/// higher risk of database file corruption upon abnormal termination
	/// of a session against a database.<br /><br />
	/// An example of possible usage:<br />
	/// <code>
	/// RandomAccessFileAdapter randomAccessFileAdapter = new RandomAccessFileAdapter();<br />
	/// NonFlushingIoAdapter nonFlushingIoAdapter = new NonFlushingIoAdapter(randomAccessFileAdapter);<br />
	/// CachedIoAdapter cachedIoAdapter = new CachedIoAdapter(nonFlushingIoAdapter);<br />
	/// Configuration configuration = Db4o.newConfiguration();<br />
	/// configuration.io(cachedIoAdapter);<br />
	/// </code>
	/// <br /><br />
	/// db4o uses a resume-commit-on-crash strategy to ensure ACID transactions.
	/// When a transaction commits,<br />
	/// - (1) a list "pointers that are to be modified" is written to the database file,<br />
	/// - (2) the database file is switched into "in-commit" mode, <br />
	/// - (3) the pointers are actually modified in the database file,<br />
	/// - (4) the database file is switched to "not-in-commit" mode.<br />
	/// If the system is halted by a hardware or power failure <br />
	/// - before (2)<br />
	/// all objects will be available as before the commit<br />
	/// - between (2) and (4)
	/// the commit is restarted when the database file is opened the next time, all pointers
	/// will be read from the "pointers to be modified" list and all of them will be modified
	/// to the state they are intended to have after commit<br />
	/// - after (4)
	/// no work is necessary, the transaction is committed.
	/// <br /><br />
	/// In order for the above to be 100% failsafe, the order of writes to the
	/// storage medium has to be obeyed. On operating systems that use in-memory
	/// file caching, the OS cache may revert the order of writes to optimize
	/// file performance.<br /><br />
	/// db4o enforces the correct write order by calling
	/// <see cref="Sync()">Sync()</see>
	/// after every single one of the above steps during transaction
	/// commit. The calls to
	/// <see cref="Sync()">Sync()</see>
	/// have a high performance cost.
	/// By using this IoAdapter it is possible to omit these calls, at the cost
	/// of a risc of corrupted database files upon hardware-, power- or operating
	/// system failures.<br /><br />
