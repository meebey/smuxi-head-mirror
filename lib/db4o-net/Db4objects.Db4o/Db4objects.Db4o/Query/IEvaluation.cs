	/// To constrain a

	/// node with your own callback
	/// <code>Evaluation</code>, construct an object that implements the
	/// <code>Evaluation</code> interface and register it by passing it

	/// <see cref="IQuery.Constrain(object)">IQuery.Constrain(object)</see>
	/// .
	/// <br /><br />
	/// Evaluations are called as the last step during query execution,
	/// after all other constraints have been applied. Evaluations in higher
	/// level
	/// <see cref="IQuery">IQuery</see>
	/// nodes in the query graph are called first.
	/// <br /><br />Java client/server only:<br />
	/// db4o first attempts to use Java Serialization to allow to pass final
	/// variables to the server. Please make sure that all variables that are
	/// used within the
	/// <see cref="Evaluate(ICandidate)">Evaluate(ICandidate)</see>
	/// method are Serializable. This may include
	/// the class an anonymous Evaluation object is created in. If db4o is
	/// not successful at using Serialization, the Evaluation is transported
	/// to the server in a db4o
	/// <see cref="Db4objects.Db4o.IO.MemoryBin">Db4objects.Db4o.IO.MemoryBin</see>
	/// . In this case final variables can
	/// not be restored.
