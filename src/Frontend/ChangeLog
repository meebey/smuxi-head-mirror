	* Makefile.am: Replaced hardcoded gmcs calls with configure variable.

2008-09-28  Mirco Bauer <meebey@meebey.net> 

	* EngineManager.cs: Refactored SSH command code into
	  CreatePlinkProcessStartInfo() and CreateOpenSshProcessStartInfo().
	
	  Don't let OpenSSH detach, as that makes process control impossible, and
	  plink doesn't support it anyhow.
	
	  Added ssh program, stderror and stdout to error message.

2008-09-28  Mirco Bauer <meebey@meebey.net> 

	* EngineManager.cs: We have to use and check for plink.exe and not
	  putty.exe.

2008-09-28  Mirco Bauer <meebey@meebey.net> 

	* EngineManager.cs: Check if sshProgram is present on the harddisk.
	
	  Added hack for putty support: if sshProgram is putty.exe use -P instead
	  of -p.
