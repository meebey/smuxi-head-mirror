	* FrontendManager.cs: Don't prevent removing chats when they are not synced
	  yet, as that causes a race condition when someone enters and leaves
	  right-away a chat and thus is not being on the frontend side. Also
	  problematic servers (like psyBNC) could cause such "enter chat, no sync,
	  can't remove chat" situation. (closes trac bug #144)
